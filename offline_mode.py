Iâ€™m Harsharaj Shetty B, someone who finds joy in building things that combine creativity and logic. 
From coding websites to designing visuals to experimenting with tech projects, I see each 
challenge as a chance to learn and create something meaningful. 
I started out exploring design and development just out of curiosity, but over time it turned
 into a passion that shaped my work and businesses. 
Today, I run ventures like SparkBee Technologies, Cucoon, and Aquatic.In, while also diving
 deep into side projects ranging from IoT systems to AI-based solutions.
